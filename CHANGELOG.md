# [3.9.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v3.8.0...v3.9.0) (2017-11-08)

### Upgrade Instructions
`ionic-angular` 3.9.0 adds support for `@angular` 5.0.0 :tada:! It is a drop-in replacement for `ionic-angular` 3.8.x.

To update, remove existing `node_modules` and any lock files, and then update `package.json` to the following deps.

```
"dependencies" : {
  ...
  "@angular/common": "5.0.0",
  "@angular/compiler": "5.0.0",
  "@angular/compiler-cli": "5.0.0",
  "@angular/core": "5.0.0",
  "@angular/forms": "5.0.0",
  "@angular/http": "5.0.0",
  "@angular/platform-browser": "5.0.0",
  "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "5.0.0",
  "@ionic/storage": "2.1.3",
  "ionic-angular": "3.9.0",
  "rxjs": "5.5.2",
  "zone.js": "0.8.18"
  ...
},
"devDependencies: {
  "@ionic/app-scripts": "3.1.0",
  "typescript" : "2.4.2"
}
```

If your app uses RXJS, see the instructions below to update.

### RXJS 5.5.2 Updates

The recent update of RXJS includes a change in how operators are applied.

Traditionally, operators were applied like this:

```typescript
import 'rxjs/add/operator/debounceTime';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/switchMap';

export MyClass {


  someMethod(){
    // Using Reactive Forms
    this.input.valueChanges
    .debounceTime(500)
    .switchMap(inputVal => this.service.get(inputVal))
    .subscribe(res => console.log(res))
  }
}
```

This approach involved modifying the Observable prototype and patching on the
methods.

RXJS 5.5 introduces a different way to do this that can lead to significantly
smaller code bundles, lettable operators.

To use lettable operators, modify the code from above to look like this:

```typescript
//Use Deep imports here for smallest bunlde size
import { debounceTime } from 'rxjs/operators/debounceTime';
import { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators/switchMap';

export MyClass {


  someMethod(){
    // Using Reactive Forms
    // We use the new `.pipe` method on the observable
    // too apply operators now

    this.input.valueChanges
    .pipe(
      debounceTime(500),
      switchMap(inputVal => this.service.get(inputVal))
    )
    .subscribe(res => console.log(res))
  }
}
```

This slight change allows only import the operators we need in our code. This will result in a smaller, faster application. This example uses Deep Imports, which allow the module we want to import to be isolated.

Take a look at [this
doc](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/lettable-operators.md) for more information.

<a name="3.6.0"></a>
# [3.6.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v3.5.3...v3.6.0) (2017-07-27)


### Upgrade Instructions

`ionic-angular` 3.6.0 requires developer's to update to the latest version of the `Ionic CLI` and `@ionic/app-scripts`.

To upgrade, please run

```
npm install -g ionic@latest
npm install @ionic/app-scripts@latest --save-dev
npm install ionic-angular@latest --save
```

### Notes

The URL when using deep linking is shortened and improved in this release. Due to a limitation in our nav system, if you're using `ion-tabs` and have a tab name that matches a segment, meaning you have a tab name of `schedule` and a segment of `schedule`, there could potentially be issues. To mitigate these issues, make sure you set the `tabUrlPath` property on the `ion-tab` and give it a unique name. This limitation will require an API change to fix so it will be resolved in `ionic-angular` 4.x.


The upgrades include necessary changes to generators that add back lazy loading functionality, as well as an improved way of generating component/directives/and pipes.

### New Generators

The release adds back the functionality to generate lazy loaded pages.
To generate a lazy loaded page, run:

```bash
ionic g page <Page-Name>
```

This will include a `.module.ts` file in the page directory created. If you do not want to generate a lazy loaded page, you can run:

```bash
ionic g page <Page-Name> --no-module
```

This will also generate lazy loaded tabs as well, accepting the `--no-module` flag as well to disable it.


For pipes/components/components, we now generate a shared common module for each of these.

So running:

```bash
ionic g component music-card
```

Will create a `components/components.module.ts` file that declares and exports the `music-card` component.
We think that this will allow developers to get up and running with custom components much faster and will less overhead.

### Bug Fixes

## [3.5.3](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v3.5.2...v3.5.3) (2017-07-14)

## Upgrade Instructions
`ionic-angular@3.5.3` is a drop-in replacement for `3.5.2`. To install it, simply run `npm install ionic-angular@3.5.3 --save --save-exact`.

### Bug Fixes

* **app:** restore getActiveNav api ([2d49e10](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/commit/2d49e10))



<a name="3.5.2"></a>
## [3.5.2](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v3.5.1...v3.5.2) (2017-07-13)

## Upgrade Instructions
`ionic-angular@3.5.2` is a drop-in replacement for `3.5.1`. To install it, simply run `npm install ionic-angular@3.5.2 --save --save-exact`.

We have released a new version of our build process for `ionic-angular` apps, `@ionic/app-scripts` in conjunction with this release of `ionic-angular`. While it's not a required update, we recommend it because we have greatly improved the developer experience. Incremental, or update builds while developing are much faster now. We've also added `scope hoisting` for better start-up performance on production builds.

To upgrade to `@ionic/app-scripts`, run the following command:

```
rm -rf node_modules
npm install @ionic/app-scripts@2.0.2 --save-dev --save-exact
```

After installing the update, you'll need to make a minor change to the `src/index.html` file to include a new `<script>` tag for `build/vendor.js`. The reason for this breaking change in `@ionic/app-scripts` is for faster builds. By separating out the `node_modules` dependencies into a `vendor.js` file, the incremental build is faster.

```
...
<body>

  <!-- Ionic's root component and where the app will load -->
  <ion-app></ion-app>

  <!-- cordova.js required for cordova apps -->
  <script src="cordova.js"></script>

  <!-- The polyfills js is generated during the build process -->
  <script src="build/polyfills.js"></script>

  <!-- The vendor js is generated during the build process
       and includes all files in the node_modules directory -->
  <script src="build/vendor.js"></script>

  <!-- The bundle js is generated during the build process -->
  <script src="build/main.js"></script>

</body>
...
```

If you're customizing `@ionic/app-scripts`, we recommend you review the [changelog](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), and update any of your configs accordingly.

## Notes
`3.5.2` is the same as `3.5.1`. We had a small publishing error.

## [3.5.1](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v3.5.0...v3.5.1) (2017-07-13)

See the [3.5.2](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#352-2017-07-13) changelog. We had a publishing error here.

<a name="3.5.0"></a>
# [3.5.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v3.4.2...v3.5.0) (2017-06-28)

### Steps to Upgrade

`ionic-angular` should be set to version `3.5.0`.

```
npm install ionic-angular@3.5.0 --save --save-exact
```

### Notes
There were major improvements made to navigation in this release of `ionic-angular`. Specifically, we updated Ionic to support a concept of `n` root navigation elements, instead of just one. This will enable first-class url support for things `split-pane`. Before `3.5.0`, only one section of the screen could be represented in the URL. With these changes, multiple sections can be. Another large change was improving the behavior surrounding browser behaviors, such as the back-and-forward buttons, as well as refresh. In general, Ionic should work much more intuitively in a web browser now.

As a result of these improvements, if you're using deep linking, the urls of the application will be different with `3.5.0` than they were with previous Ionic releases. The URLs will likely change again in the near future with the next round of navigation improvements too. For now, we don't recommend using `href` attributes in the application. Using the `navPush` and `navPop` directives is a better option for now while URL support is being built-out.

<a name="3.3.0"></a>
# [3.3.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v3.2.1...v3.3.0) (2017-05-24)


### Steps to Upgrade

`ionic-angular` now supports the latest `@angular` (4.1.2), and `typescript` (2.3.3) versions. Feel free to update apps by updating the `package.json` dependencies to match below:

```
"dependencies": {
  "@angular/common": "4.1.2",
  "@angular/compiler": "4.1.2",
  "@angular/compiler-cli": "4.1.2",
  "@angular/core": "4.1.2",
  "@angular/forms": "4.1.2",
  "@angular/http": "4.1.2",
  "@angular/platform-browser": "4.1.2",
  "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "4.1.2",
  "@ionic-native/core": "3.10.2",
  "@ionic-native/splash-screen": "3.10.2",
  "@ionic-native/status-bar": "3.10.2",
  "@ionic/storage": "2.0.1",
  "ionic-angular": "3.3.0",
  "ionicons": "3.0.0",
  "rxjs": "5.1.1",
  "sw-toolbox": "3.6.0",
  "zone.js": "0.8.11"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@ionic/app-scripts": "1.3.7",
  "typescript": "2.3.3"
}
```

Another optional step is to remove the `src/declarations.d.ts` file. This is a legacy file introduced early with `ionic-angular` projects to improve compatibility between TypeScript and third-party libraries. Due to improvements in TypeScript, this file is no longer necessary. By removing this file, the TypeScript compiler will be able to provide more accurate error messages for `import` statements.

### Steps to Upgrade to 3.0

With this release comes a major update to Angular (Angular 4.0!), the latest version of TypeScript, and some optional structural changes to your application.

1. Update your package.json to match the following dependencies, remove the existing `node_modules` directory, and then run `npm install`:

  ```
  "dependencies": {
      "@angular/common": "4.0.0",
      "@angular/compiler": "4.0.0",
      "@angular/compiler-cli": "4.0.0",
      "@angular/core": "4.0.0",
      "@angular/forms": "4.0.0",
      "@angular/http": "4.0.0",
      "@angular/platform-browser": "4.0.0",
      "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "4.0.0",
      "@ionic-native/core": "3.4.2",
      "@ionic-native/splash-screen": "3.4.2",
      "@ionic-native/status-bar": "3.4.2",
      "@ionic/storage": "2.0.1",
      "ionic-angular": "3.0.1",
      "ionicons": "3.0.0",
      "rxjs": "5.1.1",
      "sw-toolbox": "3.4.0",
      "zone.js": "^0.8.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@ionic/app-scripts": "1.3.0",
    "typescript": "~2.2.1"
  }
  ```

2. Import the `BrowserModule` in your `app/app.module.ts` file:

  ```
  import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
  ```

  and then add it to the imports in the same file:

  ```
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp)
  ],
  ```

3. If you are using `Http`, import the `HttpModule` in your `app/app.module.ts` file:

  ```
  import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';
  ```

  and then add it to the imports in the same file:

  ```
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    HttpModule,
    IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp)
  ],
  ```

4. Upgrading to Ionic Native 3.x will result in a smaller bundle size. With Ionic Native 3, native functionality was moved from static methods to using Angular injectables.
  - Blog Post: http://blog.ionic.io/ionic-native-3-x/
  - Example Upgrade Commit: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app/commit/62088

And that’s it! Your app should still function the same without any issues.

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Grid

Removed the deprecated (old) grid. See the blog post for more information including steps to migrate:
http://blog.ionic.io/build-awesome-desktop-apps-with-ionics-new-responsive-grid/

#### Typography

The following selectors to style the text color of the native text elements have been removed:

```
h1[color], h2[color], h3[color], h4[color], h5[color], h6[color], a[color]:not([ion-button]):not([ion-item]):not([ion-fab]), p[color], span[color], b[color], i[color], strong[color], em[color], small[color], sub[color], sup[color]
```

These have been throwing a deprecation warning since rc.3 but still working. They are officially gone and therefore these elements will not get the color unless the `ion-text` attribute is added. Please see the documentation for more information: https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/components/typography/Typography/

#### Slides

The following properties and functions have been printing console warnings and are officially removed:

Slides input `options` has been removed. Please use the input
properties instead.

Slide event `ionWillChange` has been removed, please use
`ionSlideWillChange` instead.

Slide event `ionDidChange` has been removed, please use
`ionSlideDidChange` instead.

Slide event `ionDrag` has been removed, please use `ionSlideDrag`
instead.

Slides `getSlider()` method has been removed, please use the instance
of ion-slides.

  Note: If you are using `ionic-storage`, you need to update it to `2.0.0` or you will run into an error similar to this: `Error: Can't resolve all parameters for Storage: (?, ?).`. For more information, see the [Storage Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/storage/).

### What's new

#### Split Pane
As part of our initiative to improve desktop support we have introduced a new component called [Split Pane](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/components/split-pane/SplitPane/). Split Pane makes it possible to easily create multi-view layouts. It allows elements, such as a menu or another navigation pane, to be displayed on large viewports. Split Pane can be used to achieve a layout similar to the Gmail (Android) or Mail (Apple) applications.

#### Angular 2.4.8
Ionic has been updated to depend on Angular 2.4.8, which is the latest version that we have tested and confirmed to be compatible with Ionic. This means that updating to the 2.2.0 release of Ionic will automatically work with all of the performance updates, bug fixes and features in Angular 2.4.8!

### Ionic Storage

We recently released the 2.0.0 version of `ionic-storage`. If you are using Ionic Storage in your application, you need to update to this version of `ionic-storage`. Attempting to use an older version of `ionic-storage` with Ionic 2.2.0 will cause errors. You can read about how to update to `ionic-storage` 2.0.0 [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-storage/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

### Updating to 2.0.0-rc.6

1. Update the framework:

    ```
    npm install --save --save-exact ionic-angular@2.0.0-rc.6
    ```

2. Change the import for ionicons in your `theme/variables.scss` file from this:

    ```
    @import "ionicons";
    ```

    to

    ```
    @import "ionic.ionicons";
    ```

    See the [conference app](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app/blob/master/src/theme/variables.scss#L81) for an example. This fixes a bug with ionicons getting styled incorrectly.

### Updating to 2.0.0-rc.5

1. Update to the latest version of the Ionic CLI:

  ```
  npm uninstall -g ionic
  npm install -g ionic
  ```

2. Update your `package.json` to match the following dependencies, remove existing `node_modules` directory, and then run `npm install`:

  ```
  "dependencies": {
      "@angular/common": "2.2.1",
      "@angular/compiler": "2.2.1",
      "@angular/compiler-cli": "2.2.1",
      "@angular/core": "2.2.1",
      "@angular/forms": "2.2.1",
      "@angular/http": "2.2.1",
      "@angular/platform-browser": "2.2.1",
      "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "2.2.1",
      "@angular/platform-server": "2.2.1",
      "@ionic/storage": "1.1.7",
      "ionic-angular": "2.0.0-rc.5",

      "typescript": "2.0.9"
    }
  ```

  Note: please ensure you are using the exact TypeScript and Angular versions listed above. There have been issues with the latest versions.


### What’s changed?
Internal refactor completed in order to improve tree shaking and dead code removal. The public API, with the exception of the slides component, has stayed the same. However, internally many changes were required so bundlers could better exclude modules which should not be bundled. Ultimately most changes resorted to removing references to `window` or `document`, or a module that referenced one of those.

### What’s new?
Service Worker Toolbox ([sw-toolbox](https://googlechrome.github.io/sw-toolbox/docs/releases/v3.2.0/)) is now built in to the starters and conference app. This allows you to customize your service worker using a high level API instead of using the raw service worker API. Our out of the box configuration will give your app a good, network independent experience but you can easily customize this to fit your app’s unique use cases.


### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Inputs
As part of the refactor to improve tree shaking the `TextArea` has been merged into the `TextInput` class. This means that if you are importing the `TextArea` class you will need to change this to be `TextInput`.

#### Slides

ion-slides was refactored to remove the external dependencies, and rewritten in TypeScript/ES6 modules to again improve tree shaking abilities. In order to work with tree shaking, the `options` attribute had to be removed. See the [Slides API Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/components/slides/Slides/) for usage information.

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Toolbar

* Renamed the `no-shadow` attribute for Material Design header, footer, and
tabs to `no-border`. This is the same attribute used by iOS mode.
* Moved the border on iOS from each toolbar to the last toolbar in a header, and the
first toolbar in a footer. Adding `no-border` to the header or footer will hide the border.

  For example, the following code:

  ```
  <ion-header>
    <ion-navbar no-border-bottom></ion-navbar>
    <ion-toolbar no-border-top></ion-toolbar>
  </ion-header>
  ```

  will now become:

  ```
  <ion-header>
    <ion-navbar></ion-navbar>
    <ion-toolbar></ion-toolbar>
  </ion-header>
  ```

  and if you decide you don't want the border just add `no-border` to the header: `<ion-header no-border>`.

* This means that `no-border-top` and `no-border-bottom` will not work on iOS and should
be removed from any toolbars using it.


#### Events

* The argument passed to the `events.subscribe(args)` function is no longer an array of parameters.
Instead, it will be called with the same parameters used in `events.publish(arg1, arg2)`

  For example, the following code:


  ```
  events.subscribe('user:created', args => {
    console.log('Welcome ', args[0], ' at ', args[1]);
  });
  ```

  will now become:

  ```
  events.subscribe('user:created', (user, time) => {
    console.log('Welcome ', user, ' at ', time);
  });
  ```

<a name="2.0.0-rc.0"></a>
# [2.0.0-rc.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v2.0.0-beta.11...v2.0.0-rc.0) (2016-09-28)

RC0 requires changes to the structure of your app. To get started updating your app see the [Steps to Upgrade](#steps-to-upgrade-to-rc0) below.

* Ionic 2 API finalized for `2.0.0` release
* Angular `2.0.0` final!
* `ionViewCanEnter` / `ionViewCanLeave` lifecycle events
* Floating Action Button (FAB) lists
* Ahead of Time (AoT) compiler ready
* Components can now individually set a mode, which means an app can mix and match iOS / Material Design / Windows Platform modes if that’s desired
* Typescript 2.0
* `@types` support for third-party libraries
* Move away from `gulp` ([ionic-gulp-tasks](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-gulp-tasks)) to `npm scripts` ([ionic-app-scripts](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts))
* Use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) for bundling instead of `browserify` or `webpack`


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Angular upgrade to [2.0.0](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/rc4-to-rc5.html)
* [Renamed Lifecycle events](#lifecycle-events-renamed).
* Storage has been removed from `ionic-angular` and placed into a separate module, `@ionic/storage`. Starters have been updated to add this, make sure to add it to your `package.json` if you’re using the storage system. See more [details here](#storage).
* Nav transitions are queued. For more info on what this means for you see [this section](#nav-transitions).
* Removed Tabs `preloadTabs` ability. This is no longer needed with the Ahead of Time (AoT) compiler.
* Icons in buttons require an attribute on the parent button in order to style them.
* Platform and mode CSS classes have been moved from the `<body>` element to the `<ion-app>` element.
* Select’s `alertOptions` input has been renamed to `selectOptions`. See more [details here](#select-changes).
* Colors should be passed in the `color` input on components, not added individually as an attribute on the component. See more [details here](#component-colors).
* buttons: `<button>` becomes `<button ion-button>`. See more [details here](#new-behavior-of-button) and [here](#new-behavior-of-icons-in-buttons).
* Head link tags for CSS files are no longer dynamically updated, but one CSS file is imported.
(Future build processes will narrow down the CSS file further to only include what’s used). See more [details here](#update-css-link-tags).
* The `<scroll-content>` element, which is internal to `<ion-content>`, has been renamed to `<div class="scroll-content">` since it was neither a directive nor a web component.
* `<ion-fixed>` has been removed, use `<div ion-fixed>` instead.
* Sass: Changes to how Sass is imported. See more [details here](#sass-import).
* Typings: We have stopped using the `typings` tool and have migrated to `npm @types`. See more [details here](#typings).
* Components no longer get a CSS class added based on the component class name. This should be added using the Component selector. See the [Steps to Upgrade](#steps-to-upgrade-to-rc0) for more information on this change.


#### Lifecycle Events Renamed

* Renamed `ionViewLoaded` to `ionViewDidLoad`
* Removed `ionViewDidUnload`
* Removed `fireOtherLifecycles` from `ViewController`


#### Nav Transitions

Nav transitions are now queued. Meaning if you run:

```
navCtrl.push(Page1);
navCtrl.push(Page2);
```

`Page1` will transition in, then immediately `Page2` will transition in. There can never be two transitions happening at the same time.

Page transition promises can now possibly reject the returned promises. Used mainly for `ionViewCanEnter` and `ionViewCanLeave`.


#### Component Colors

Colors are no longer added directly to a component, they should instead be passed in the `color` attribute.

For example:

```
<ion-tabs primary>
```

Becomes

```
<ion-tabs color="primary">
```

Or to bind an expression to color:

```
<ion-navbar [color]="barColor">
   ...
</ion-navbar>
```

```ts
@Component({
  templateUrl: 'build/pages/about/about.html'
})
export class AboutPage {
  barColor: string;

  constructor(private nav: NavController, platform: Platform) {
    this.barColor = platform.is('android') ? 'primary' : 'light';
  }
}
```

Components with this property:
- Badge
- Button
- Checkbox
- Chip
- FAB
- Icon
- Item (Item, Item Divider, List Header)
- Label
- Navbar
- Radio
- Searchbar
- Segment
- Spinner
- Tabs
- Toggle
- Toolbar
- Typography (headers, paragraphs, spans, etc.)

**Reason for this change:**
- It was difficult to dynamically add colors to components, especially if the name of the color attribute was unknown in the template.
- This change keeps the css flat since we aren’t chaining color attributes on components and instead we assign a class to the component which includes the color’s name.
- This allows you to easily toggle a component between multiple colors.
- Speeds up performance because we are no longer reading through all of the attributes to grab the color ones.


#### Select Changes

Select’s `alertOptions` input has been renamed to `selectOptions`. It now allows you to pass options for either the alert or action-sheet interface. Refer to their documentation for the options each of them accept.

- [ActionSheet](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/components/action-sheet/ActionSheetController/#create)
- [Alert](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/components/alert/AlertController/#create)


#### New Behavior of Button

- `<button>` becomes `<button ion-button>`
- `<a button>` becomes `<a ion-button>`
- `<button ion-item>` does not get the `ion-button` attribute
- Buttons inside of `<ion-item-options>` do get the `ion-button` attribute
- Removed the `category` attribute, this should be passed in
`ion-button` instead.

**Reason for this change:**
- It was difficult to have custom buttons since buttons automatically received the Ionic styles. The user can now take advantage of adding their own styling to a button if they want it to behave differently than the Ionic button.
Keeping the `<a>` and `<button>` element and adding `ion-button` as an attribute gives us the ability to take advantage of the native functionality and built-in accessibility of native elements. If Ionic provided an `<ion-button>` we’d have to copy over all the possible attributes and events to the real nested button/link (`type=submit`, `formnovalidate`, `value`, `autofocus`, `href`, `target`, `focus`/`blur`, `download`, `nofollow`, `ping`, etc). Additionally, Angular does not have the "replace" directive where `<ion-button>` could be turned into `<a ion-button>`.
- Since `button` was already being used as an attribute to the `<a>` element, this is more consistent between the two.
- If a navPush or navPop directive is on an `<a ion-button>`, Ionic can automatically add the `href` attribute.
- [A few reasons why we didn’t create `<ion-button>`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g&v=CZGqnp06DnI)


#### New Behavior of Icons in Buttons

1. Icon only buttons

  ```
  <button>
    <ion-icon name="rainy"></ion-icon>
  </button>
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  <button ion-button icon-only>
    <ion-icon name="rainy"></ion-icon>
  </button>
  ```

2. Icon left of text in a button

  ```
  <button>
    <ion-icon name="rainy"></ion-icon>
    Rainy
  </button>
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  <button ion-button icon-left>
    <ion-icon name="rainy"></ion-icon>
    Rainy
  </button>
  ```

3. Icon right of text in a button

  ```
  <button>
    Rainy
    <ion-icon name="rainy"></ion-icon>
  </button>
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  <button ion-button icon-right>
    Rainy
    <ion-icon name="rainy"></ion-icon>
  </button>
  ```

4. Item option buttons - the `icon-left` attribute should still be added to the `<ion-item-options>` container and not the button itself.
5. `menuToggle` buttons should not get the `icon-only` attribute

**Reason for this change:**
There was a noticeable performance decrease from us reading in each button to determine where icons were placed and how to style them. This change improves performance. This adds styling so that the buttons and icons will be padded a certain amount, but the user is free to leave these attributes off and style the components themselves.


#### Update CSS Link Tags

Ionic stylesheets are no longer dynamically loaded per platform. Instead there will be one CSS file to import. Note that future build processes will slim down the CSS file even further to only include component CSS actually used.

In the head of your `index.html` file, replace:

```
<!-- ionic dynamically decides which stylesheet to load -->
<link ios-href="build/css/app.ios.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link md-href="build/css/app.md.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link wp-href="build/css/app.wp.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

With:

```
<link href="build/main.css" rel="stylesheet">
```


#### Sass Import

The default configuration will be updated, but if your existing app is using Sass and importing Ionic Sass files directly you’ll need to update the `includePaths` of Node Sass.

```
node_modules/ionic-angular/themes
```

Next, to include Ionic into your custom Sass file you’ll need to update the Ionic import to this:

```
@import "ionic.theme.default";
```


#### Typings

Any type definitions for third party libraries that are included via the `typings` tool and are included in the the `typings.json` file should be updated to use `npm @types`. An example of how this looks is:

```
npm install @types/lodash --save-dev --save-exact
```

Delete the `typings.json` file, and the `typings` directory.


#### Storage

The storage utilities have been moved outside of the framework to a separate library called `@ionic/storage`.

This library can be installed by executing the following command:

```
npm install @ionic/storage --save --save-exact
```

It must be included in the app's `NgModule` list of `providers`:

```
import { Storage } from '@ionic/storage';

...

@NgModule({
  ...
  providers: [Storage]
})

```

It can then be injected into any class that needs access to it:

```
import { Storage } from '@ionic/storage';

...

export class MyAwesomePage {
  constructor(public storage: Storage) {
  }

  ionViewDidEnter() {

    this.storage.get('myKey').then( (value:any) => {
      console.log('My value is:', value);
    });
  }
}
```


#### Deployment Changes

`ionic-angular` package includes es5 code with es2015 module import/exports, `umd` modules, and pure `es2015` code. The `package.json` is set up using the `main` and `module` options to make this work seamlessly.


### Steps to Upgrade to RC0

We are providing 2 ways to update your app with this release: [Copying your Project to a New Project](#copying-your-project-to-a-new-project) and [Modifying your Existing Project](#modifying-your-existing-project). The first way will guide you through creating a new Ionic 2 project and copying your project files to it. This is the easiest way to update your app in our opinion. The second way will step through how to update your existing project. There are a lot of steps involved with this way, and we recommend viewing our conference app for any clarification if you choose this way. This is it! We don’t plan on making any more major API changes after this version.

Note: For details on NgModules you can read the Angular docs on them [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html)

#### Copying your Project to a New Project

1. Ensure that you're using npm version 3.x by running:

  ```
  npm --version
  ```

  If you are not running 3.x, the easiest way to update is to install the [latest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

  You can also update `npm` by following [these instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#updating-npm).

2. Install the latest Ionic CLI:

  **Important:** if you have installed the `beta` cli you should run `npm uninstall -g ionic` first. You need version `2.1.0` for this release. Check your `cli` version by running `ionic -v` in the command line.

  ```
  npm install -g ionic
  ```

3. Create a new Ionic 2 RC0 app:

  ```
  ionic start --v2 myApp
  ```

4. Copy/paste all of your pages from `app/pages/` of your `beta.11` app to `src/pages/`, providers from `app/providers` to `src/providers`, pipes from `app/pipes` to `src/pipes` and any custom components to `src/components` in the new RC0 app.

5. Modify all `templateUrl`'s to be relative to the `.ts` file. For example in `app.component.ts` the url should change from `build/app.html` to `app.html` and in a page referencing `about.html` from `build/pages/about/about.html` to `about.html`.

6. Import and add each of your pages to the `declarations` array and the `entryComponents` array in `src/app/app.module.ts`.

7. Import and add each of your custom components and pipes to the `declarations` array in `src/app/app.module.ts`.

8. Import and add each of your providers to the `providers` array in `src/app/app.module.ts`.

9. Remove any use of the `providers`, `pipes` and `directives` arrays in `@Component`.

10. Change any uses of the `private` TypeScript keyword to `public` ONLY for component variables that are needed in the associated template.

  Note: For details as to why this change has to be made, there is a discussion about it [here](https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/rc0-typescript-private-vs-public-keyword/64863/4?u=mhartington).

11. Change `<button>` to `<button ion-button>` according to [these instructions](#new-behavior-of-button).

12. Pass colors to the `color` attribute : `<button primary>` changes to `<button color="primary">`. See [component colors](#component-colors) above.

13. Move any Ionic config to the `IonicModule.forRoot` in `app.module.ts`. For example, the config should go where it says `configObject` here: `IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp, {configObject})`.

14. Move any variables from the mode specific sass files in your `beta.11` app into the `theme/variables.scss` file under each comment section for the specific mode in the new RC0 app: [ios section](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/src/theme/variables.scss#L35-L37), [md section](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/src/theme/variables.scss#L42-L44), [wp section](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/src/theme/variables.scss#L49-L51).

15. Add selectors to each of your components that you would like to add custom styling for. These element selectors will be used for scoped sass. Previously a CSS class was dynamically added with the component class name, this is now the proper way to scope your sass for an individual page. For example, adding the `page-about` selector:

  In your component's stylesheet:

  ```
  page-about {
    #title {
      color: blue;
    }
  }
  ```

  In your component:

  ```
  @Component({
    selector: 'page-about',
    templateUrl: 'about.html'
  })
  ```


#### Modifying your Existing Project

1. Ensure that you're using npm version 3.x by running:

  ```
  npm --version
  ```

  If you are not running 3.x, the easiest way to update is to install the [latest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

  You can also update `npm` by following [these instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#updating-npm).

2. Install the latest Ionic CLI:

  **Important:** if you have installed the `beta` cli you should run `npm uninstall -g ionic` first. You need version `2.1.0` for this release. Check your `cli` version by running `ionic -v` in the command line.

  ```
  npm install -g ionic
  ```

3. Update `package.json` dependencies and devDependencies to match the [ionic2-app-base package.json](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/package.json#L15-L24), and then run `npm install` in your project folder.

4. Copy the `npm scripts` from the [ionic2-app-base package.json](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/package.json#L6-L14) to your `package.json`.

5. Delete the `gulpfile.js`.

6. Rename the `app` folder to `src`.

7. Create a new directory called `app` inside of `src`.

8. Move the `app.html` and `app.ts` files inside of `src/app`.

9. Rename `app.ts` to `app.component.ts`.

10. Add an `app.module.ts` file and copy content from [ionic2-starter-blank](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-starter-blank/blob/master/src/app/app.module.ts).

11. Move any providers from `ionicBootstrap` in your `app.component.ts` file to the providers in `app.module.ts`. Make sure to copy imports, too.

12. Import and add any of your custom components to the `declarations` array in `src/app/app.module.ts`.

13. Move any Ionic config to the `IonicModule.forRoot` in `app.module.ts`. For example, the config should go where it says `configObject` here: `IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp, {configObject})`.

14. Remove the `ionicBootstrap` code from `app.component.ts`.

15. Export the main app class in `app.component.ts` and then rename all uses of `MyApp` in `app.module.ts` to your main app class (or rename the export to `MyApp` in `app.component.ts`).

16. Fix any imports in `app.component.ts` to use the correct path. For example, `./pages` becomes `../pages`.

17. Modify `app.module.ts` to import your page specific classes. See `HomePage`, for example. All pages should be included here.

18. Fix any import paths in `app.module.ts`. For example, `./providers` becomes `../providers`.

19. Add `main.dev.ts` and `main.prod.ts` files from [ionic2-app-base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/tree/master/src/app) to `app/`.

20. Move `www/index.html` to `src/index.html` and modify it to look like [ionic2-app-base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/src/index.html), make sure to keep any external scripts you have added.

21. Move `www/assets` to `src/assets`.

22. Move `www/img` to `src/assets/img`.

23. Move any other resources you have in `www/` to `src/assets/`.

24. Modify all `templateUrl`'s to be relative to the `.ts` file. For example in `app.component.ts` the url should change from `build/app.html` to `app.html` and in a page referencing `about.html` from `build/pages/about/about.html` to `about.html`.

25. Update .gitignore to match [ionic2-app-base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/.gitignore).

26. Delete the `typings/` folder and `typings.json` file.

27. Update `tsconfig.json` to match [ionic2-app-base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/tsconfig.json).

28. Rename and relocate `app/theme/app.variables.scss` to `src/theme/variables.scss`.

29. Move app Sass rule files from `app/theme` to `src/app`. This includes `app.core.scss`, `app.ios.scss`, etc.

30. Move any variables from the mode specific sass files in your `beta.11` app into the `theme/variables.scss` file under each comment section for the specific mode in the new RC0 app: [ios section](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/src/theme/variables.scss#L35-L37), [md section](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/src/theme/variables.scss#L42-L44), [wp section](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/src/theme/variables.scss#L49-L51).

31. Fix any paths to images in your app. For example, before the path may look like `<img src="img/myImg.png">` and now it should be `<img src="assets/img/myImg.png">`.

32. Change any uses of the `private` TypeScript keyword to `public` ONLY for component variables that are needed in the associated template.

  Note: For details as to why this change has to be made, there is a discussion about it [here](https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/rc0-typescript-private-vs-public-keyword/64863/4?u=mhartington).

33. Change any Ionic buttons from `<button>` to `<button ion-button>`. [See New Behavior of Button](#new-behavior-of-button).

34. Pass colors to the `color` attribute: `<button primary>` changes to `<button color="primary">`.

35. Add appropriate icon attributes, if the icon is on the left of the text in a button it should get `icon-left`, if the icon is on the right add `icon-right`, and if the button only has an icon in it, add the `icon-only` attribute to the button. [See New Behavior of Icons in Buttons](#new-behavior-of-icons-in-buttons).

36. Add selectors to each of your components that you would like to add custom styling for. These element selectors will be used for scoped sass. Previously a CSS class was dynamically added with the component class name, this is now the proper way to scope your sass for an individual page. For example, adding the `page-about` selector:

  In your component's stylesheet:

  ```
  page-about {
    #title {
      color: blue;
    }
  }
  ```

  In your component:

  ```
  @Component({
    selector: 'page-about',
    templateUrl: 'about.html'
  })
  ```

37. Remove any use of the `providers`, `pipes` and `directives` arrays in `@Component`.

<a name="2.0.0-beta.11"></a>
# [2.0.0-beta.11](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v2.0.0-beta.10...v2.0.0-beta.11) (2016-08-05)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Angular2 has been updated to [RC4](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-rc4-2016-06-30).
- ViewController’s `onDismiss` has been renamed to `onDidDismiss`
- Forms have been upgraded to `@angular/forms` - [Angular2 Forms Changes](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1RIezQqE4aEhBRmArIAS1mRIZtWFf6JxN_7B4meyWK0Y/pub).
- [Overlay components](#overlays) should now be created with their injected provider.
- The [Select Options](#select--option-7334) `checked` attribute has been renamed to `selected`.
- [Tab’s input and config variables](#tab-inputconfig-7143) have been renamed.
- [Material Design tabs](#material-design-tabs-7455) have been updated to resemble Material Design’s bottom navigation spec: https://material.google.com/components/bottom-navigation.html
- [Input highlight](#input-highlight-6449) was added as an option for `ios` and `wp` mode, but defaults to false.
- Please review the [Steps to Upgrade](#steps-to-upgrade-to-beta-11) below.

#### Overlays

- Overlay components, such as Alert or Modals, should now be created using its injected provider.
- Overlays now have the `present()` method on the overlay’s instance, rather than using `nav.present(overlayInstance)`.
- All overlays now present on top of all app content, to include menus.
- Below is an example of the change to `Alert`, but the pattern is the same for all overlays: ActionSheet, Loading, Modal, Picker, Popover, Toast

  WAS:

  ```
  import { NavController, Alert } from ‘ionic-angular’;

  constructor(public nav: NavController) {
  }

  doAlert() {
    let alert = Alert.create({
       title: 'Alert',
    });
    this.nav.present(alert);
  }
  ```

  NOW:

  ```
  import { AlertController } from ‘ionic-angular’;

  constructor(public alertCtrl: AlertController) {
  }

  doAlert() {
    let alert = this.alertCtrl.create({
      title: 'Alert'
    });
    alert.present();
  }
  ```


#### Select / Option [#7334](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/7334)

The Option component’s `checked` attribute has been renamed to `selected` in order to make an option selected. This follows the MDN spec for a select option: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option

If a `ngModel` is added to the Select component the value of the `ngModel` will take precedence over the `selected` attribute.

See the [Select](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/components/select/Select/) and [Option](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/components/option/Option/) documentation for usage examples.

#### Tab Input/Config [#7143](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/7143)

Tab input/config options have been renamed. The following options were
renamed:

- `tabbarHighlight` -> `tabsHighlight`
- `tabbarLayout` -> `tabsLayout`
- `tabSubPages` -> `tabsHideOnSubPages`
- `tabbarPlacement` -> `tabsPlacement`

The previous names have been deprecated. They will still work in the
current release but will be removed in the future so please update to
the new names.

#### Material Design Tabs [#7455](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/7455)

Material Design mode defaults have changed to the following:

```
tabsHighlight: false,
tabsPlacement: 'bottom',
tabsHideOnSubPages: false
```

`tabsHighlight` can now be passed as an attribute on the `ion-tabs` element, this allows for tabs to be added in multiple places inside of an app and enable the highlight on some of them.

Styling of the Material Design tabs reflects the spec for bottom navigation: https://material.google.com/components/bottom-navigation.html

To get the old style of tabs, override the config in your bootstrap, for example:

```
ionicBootstrap(ConferenceApp, [ConferenceData, UserData], {
  platforms: {
    android: {
      tabsPlacement: 'top',
      tabsHideOnSubPages: true,
      tabsHighlight: true
    }
  }
});
```

And optionally override any of the Sass variables for `md` mode in `theme/app.md.scss`:

```
$tabs-md-tab-text-capitalization: uppercase;
$tabs-md-tab-font-weight: 500;
$tabs-md-tab-text-transform: scale(1);
```

For a searchable list of all of the Sass variables, see the theming documentation: https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/theming/overriding-ionic-variables/


#### Input Highlight [#6449](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/6449)

Fixed typos in the input highlight variables:
- `$text-input-md-hightlight-color-valid` -> `$text-input-md-highlight-color-valid`
- `$text-input-wp-hightlight-color-valid` -> `$text-input-wp-highlight-color-valid`

Modified variables to turn on/off the highlight:

ios (defaults to false for all):

```
$text-input-ios-show-focus-highlight: false !default;
$text-input-ios-show-valid-highlight: $text-input-ios-show-focus-highlight !default;
$text-input-ios-show-invalid-highlight: $text-input-ios-show-focus-highlight !default;
```

md (defaults to true for all):

```
$text-input-md-show-focus-highlight: true !default;
$text-input-md-show-valid-highlight: $text-input-md-show-focus-highlight !default;
$text-input-md-show-invalid-highlight: $text-input-md-show-focus-highlight !default;
```

wp (defaults to true for all):

```
$text-input-wp-show-focus-highlight: true !default;
$text-input-wp-show-valid-highlight: $text-input-wp-show-focus-highlight !default;
$text-input-wp-show-invalid-highlight: $text-input-wp-show-focus-highlight !default;
```

#### Steps to Upgrade to Beta 11

1. Run the following command in a terminal to update the npm dependencies:

  ```
  npm install --save --save-exact ionic-angular@2.0.0-beta.11 @angular/common@2.0.0-rc.4 @angular/compiler@2.0.0-rc.4 @angular/core@2.0.0-rc.4 @angular/http@2.0.0-rc.4 @angular/platform-browser@2.0.0-rc.4 @angular/platform-browser-dynamic@2.0.0-rc.4 @angular/forms@0.2.0 rxjs@5.0.0-beta.6 zone.js@0.6.12
  ```

2. Update all Overlay components to be presented by their controller instead of `NavController`. For example, to update the popover component, the following code:

  ```
  constructor(private nav: NavController) {}

  presentPopover(event) {
    let popover = Popover.create(PopoverPage);
    this.nav.present(popover, { ev: event });
  }
  ```

  becomes:

  ```
  constructor(private popoverCtrl: PopoverController) {}

  presentPopover(event) {
    let popover = this.popoverCtrl.create(PopoverPage);
    popover.present({ ev: event });
  }
  ```

3. Update any uses of `ViewController.onDismiss` to `ViewController.onDidDismiss`. The following code on dismiss of a modal:

  ```
  modal.onDismiss(() => {

  });
  ```

  becomes:

  ```
  modal.onDidDismiss(() => {

  });
  ```

4. Update any uses of `checked` on an `<ion-option>` to use `selected`.

5. If you are using any of the tab config variables, update them to reflect the new names [above](#tab-inputconfig-7143).

6. If you are using any of the Sass Variables to override [tabs](#material-design-tabs-7455) or [input highlights](#input-highlight-6449), update them to reflect the new names above.

7. Please see the [Ionic Conference App](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app) for an example of upgrading to Beta 11.

<a name="2.0.0-beta.10"></a>
# [2.0.0-beta.10](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v2.0.0-beta.9...v2.0.0-beta.10) (2016-06-27)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `ion-content` now takes up 100% of the viewport height, but it has margin added to the top and bottom to adjust for headers, footers, and tabs.
- `ion-content` now accepts `fullscreen` as an attribute to to tell the content to scroll behind the header. This allows for transparent toolbars and tab pages without navbars!
- `ion-navbar` no longer has the `*navbar` attribute.
- `ion-navbar` should now be wrapped in an `ion-header`

  ```
  <ion-header>
    <ion-navbar></ion-navbar>
  </ion-header>
  ```

- `ios` only: `ion-toolbar`/`ion-navbar` will always have borders to both the top and bottom of the element. Use the attributes `no-border-top` and `no-border-bottom` to remove the respective borders.
- An `ion-nav` or `ion-tabs` is required in the root component. If one of these does not exist your content may be pushed up behind your header.
- The `position` attribute has been removed from the `ion-toolbar`, it should now be placed in an `ion-header` or an `ion-footer`. It can also be placed inside of an `ion-content`.
- The only elements that should be children of a page are `ion-header`, `ion-content`, and `ion-footer`.


#### Steps to Upgrade to Beta 10

1. Run the following command from your command prompt/terminal to update to the latest version of the Ionic framework 2:

  ```
  npm install --save ionic-angular@2.0.0-beta.10 @angular/common@2.0.0-rc.3 @angular/compiler@2.0.0-rc.3 @angular/platform-browser@2.0.0-rc.3 @angular/platform-browser-dynamic@2.0.0-rc.3 @angular/http@2.0.0-rc.3 @angular/core@2.0.0-rc.3  @angular/router@2.0.0-rc.2
  ```

2. Remove the `*navbar` attribute so this:

  ```
  <ion-navbar *navbar>
  ```

  becomes this:

  ```
  <ion-navbar>
  ```

3. Wrap any toolbars/navbars above the `ion-content` in an `ion-header`. The following:

  ```
  <ion-navbar>
    <ion-title>
      Navbar Title
    </ion-title>
  </ion-navbar>

  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>
      Toolbar Title
    </ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>

  <ion-content>

  </ion-content>
  ```

  becomes:

  ```
  <ion-header>
    <ion-navbar>
      <ion-title>
        Navbar Title
      </ion-title>
    </ion-navbar>

    <ion-toolbar>
      <ion-title>
        Toolbar Title
      </ion-title>
    </ion-toolbar>
  </ion-header>

  <ion-content>

  </ion-content>
  ```

4. Wrap any toolbars/navbars after the `ion-content` in an `ion-footer`. The following:

  ```
  <ion-content>

  </ion-content>

  <ion-toolbar position="bottom">
    <ion-title>Footer Toolbar</ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
  ```

  becomes:

  ```
  <ion-content>

  </ion-content>

  <ion-footer>
    <ion-toolbar>
      <ion-title>Footer Toolbar</ion-title>
    </ion-toolbar>
  </ion-footer>
  ```

<a name="2.0.0-beta.9"></a>
# [2.0.0-beta.9](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v2.0.0-beta.8...v2.0.0-beta.9) (2016-06-16)

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Searchbar Refactored

- Searchbar's events no longer emit the Searchbar itself, they now emit the input's `$event` for each native input event. Instead of grabbing the value from the searchbar, you should grab it from the event target. For example:

  Previously when an event was called the function called would look similar to this:

  ```
  getItems(searchbar) {
    // set q to the value of the searchbar input
    var q = searchbar.value;
  }
  ```

  Now it should be similar to this:

  ```
  getItems(ev) {
    // set q to the value of the searchbar input
    var q = ev.target.value;
  }
  ```

- `ngModel` is no longer required on Searchbar, but it can still be used. You can get the value of the input through Searchbar's [Output Events](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/components/searchbar/Searchbar/#output-events).
- Added the ability to pass `autocomplete`, `autocorrect`, `spellcheck`, and `type` to the searchbar which is passed to the input.
- The `hideCancelButton` attribute was removed in favor of `showCancelButton` which is set to `false` by default.

<a name="2.0.0-beta.8"></a>
# [2.0.0-beta.8](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/compare/v2.0.0-beta.7...v2.0.0-beta.8) (2016-06-06)


### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Ionic Decorators Removed

We’ve started the process of optimizing Ionic 2 to improve our support for Progressive Web Apps and upcoming Angular tooling. Because of this, we have removed the Ionic decorators in favor of using Angular's `Component` decorator. The following changes need to be made. For a step by step guide, see the [Steps to Upgrade to Beta 8 section](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/2.0/CHANGELOG.md#steps-to-upgrade-to-beta-8).

- `@App` and `@Page` should be replaced with `@Component`.
- `IonicApp` has been renamed to `App`.
- `ionicBootstrap` is required to bootstrap the app.
- Config is now the 3rd parameter in `ionicBootstrap(rootComponent, providers, config)`.
- Property `prodMode` is now a config option, enabling or disabling production mode.


#### Ionic Lifecycle Events Renamed

All Ionic lifecycle events have been renamed from starting with `onPage` to starting with `ionView`. These changes were made to make it more clear that the events belong to Ionic on each view.

- `onPageLoaded` renamed to `ionViewLoaded`
- `onPageWillEnter` renamed to `ionViewWillEnter`
- `onPageDidEnter` renamed to `ionViewDidEnter`
- `onPageWillLeave` renamed to `ionViewWillLeave`
- `onPageDidLeave` renamed to `ionViewDidLeave`
- `onPageWillUnload` renamed to `ionViewWillUnload`
- `onPageDidUnload` renamed to `ionViewDidUnload`


#### Ionic Component Events Renamed

All Ionic component events have been renamed to start with `ion`. This is to prevent the Ionic events from clashing with native HTML events.

- **Checkbox**
  - `change` -> `ionChange`
- **DateTime**
  - `change` -> `ionChange`
  - `cancel` -> `ionCancel`
- **InfiniteScroll**
  - `infinite` -> `ionInfinite`
- **Menu**
  - `opening` -> `ionDrag`
  - `opened` -> `ionOpen`
  - `closed` -> `ionClose`
- **Option**
  - `select` -> `ionSelect`
- **Picker**
  - `change` -> `ionChange`
- **RadioButton**
  - `select` -> `ionSelect`
- **RadioGroup**
  - `change` -> `ionChange`
- **Refresher**
  - `refresh` -> `ionRefresh`
  - `pulling` -> `ionPull`
  - `start` -> `ionStart`
- **Searchbar**
  - `input` -> `ionInput`
  - `blur` -> `ionBlur`
  - `focus` -> `ionFocus`
  - `cancel` -> `ionCancel`
  - `clear` -> `ionClear`
- **Segment**
  - `change` -> `ionChange`
  - `select` -> `ionSelect`
- **Select**
  - `change` -> `ionChange`
  - `cancel` -> `ionCancel`
- **Slides**
  - `willChange` -> `ionWillChange`
  - `didChange` -> `ionDidChange`
  - `move` -> `ionDrag`
- **TabButton**
  - `select` -> `ionSelect`
- **Tab**
  - `select` -> `ionSelect`
- **Tabs**
  - `change` -> `ionChange`
- **Toggle**
  - `change` -> `ionChange`


#### Steps to Upgrade to Beta 8

1. Upgrade to `Beta 8` by running the following command:

  ```
  npm install --save ionic-angular@2.0.0-beta.8
  ```

  _or_ modify the following line to use `beta.8` in your `package.json` and then run `npm install`:

  ```
  "ionic-angular": "^2.0.0-beta.8",
  ```

  **This is the way to update Ionic to any version, more information can be found in the [docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/resources/using-npm/).**

2. Replace all instances of `@Page` with `@Component`:

  ```
  import {Page} from 'ionic-angular';

  @Page({

  })
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  import {Component} from '@angular/core';

  @Component({

  })
  ```

3. Replace `@App` with `@Component` and then bootstrap it. Move any `config` properties into the bootstrap:

  ```
  import {App, Platform} from 'ionic-angular';

  @App({
    templateUrl: 'build/app.html',
    providers: [ConferenceData, UserData],
    config: {
      tabbarPlacement: 'bottom'
  }
  export class MyApp {

  }
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  import {Component} from '@angular/core';
  import {ionicBootstrap, Platform} from 'ionic-angular';

  @Component({
    templateUrl: 'build/app.html',
  })
  export class MyApp {

  }

  // Pass the main app component as the first argument
  // Pass any providers for your app in the second argument
  // Set any config for your app as the third argument:
  // http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/api/config/Config/

  ionicBootstrap(MyApp, [ConferenceData, UserData], {
    tabbarPlacement: 'bottom'
  });
  ```

4. Rename any uses of `IonicApp` to `App`:

  ```
  import {IonicApp} from 'ionic-angular';

  constructor(
    private app: IonicApp
  ) {
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  import {App} from 'ionic-angular';

  constructor(
    private app: App
  ) {
  ```

5. Rename any uses of the lifecycle events, for example:

  ```
  onPageDidEnter() {
    console.log("Entered page!");
  }
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  ionViewDidEnter() {
    console.log("Entered page!");
  }
  ```

  The full list of lifecycle name changes is in the [section above](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/2.0/CHANGELOG.md#ionic-lifecycle-events-renamed).

6. Rename any Ionic events, for example:

  ```
  <ion-slides (slideChangeStart)="onSlideChangeStart($event)">
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  <ion-slides (ionWillChange)="onSlideChangeStart($event)">
  ```

  The full list of event name changes is in the [section above](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/2.0/CHANGELOG.md#ionic-component-events-renamed).

  ```javascript
  import {ViewChild} from '@angular/core';
  import {Http} from '@angular/http';
  ```

5. Remove the import for `angular2-polyfills` in `index.html`:

  ```html
   <script src="build/js/angular2-polyfills.js"></script>
  ```

  and replace it with the following scripts:

  ```html
  <script src="build/js/zone.js"></script>
  <script src="build/js/Reflect.js"></script>
  ```

6. Replace all template variables in `ngFor` with `let`. For example:

  ```
  *ngFor="#session of group.sessions"
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  *ngFor="let session of group.sessions"
  ```

7. Replace all template variables in `virtualScroll`. For example:

  ```
  *virtualItem="#item"
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  *virtualItem="let item"
  ```

#### IonicApp ([df32836](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/commit/df32836)) references [#6199](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/6199)

The `getComponent` method of `IonicApp` has been removed. Please use Angular's [ViewChild](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/ViewChild-var.html) instead.

For example, the following:

```html
<ion-nav id="nav" [root]="rootPage" #content></ion-nav>
```

```javascript
import {IonicApp} from 'ionic-angular';

@App({
  templateUrl: 'build/app.html'
})
class MyApp {
  constructor(private app: IonicApp) {}

  setPage() {
    let nav = this.app.getComponent('nav');
    nav.push(MyPage);
  }
}
```

Should be changed (in TypeScript) to use the `Nav` ViewChild:

```html
<ion-nav [root]="rootPage" #content></ion-nav>
```

```javascript
import {ViewChild} from '@angular/core';
import {Nav} from 'ionic-angular';

@App({
  templateUrl: 'build/app.html'
})
class MyApp {
  @ViewChild(Nav) nav: Nav;

  constructor() {}

  setPage() {
    this.nav.push(MyPage);
  }
}
```

and the same example (in JavaScript):

```javascript
import {ViewChild} from '@angular/core';

@App({
  templateUrl: 'build/app.html',
  queries: {
    nav: new ViewChild('content')
  }
})
class MyApp {
  constructor() {}

  setPage() {
    this.nav.push(MyPage);
  }
}
```

Please see the [Ionic Conference App](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app) for more usage examples.


#### Router

The Angular router is currently under heavy development and refactoring. As a result of this, Angular’s router is currently disabled within Ionic. If your app requires use of the router we recommend waiting until a future release of Ionic when Angular has completed work on the new router. However, this does not affect Ionic’s navigation system and it continues to work with the same API from previous versions.


#### Sass Changes

##### Toolbar [#6364](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/6364)

**iOS Mode**

- `$toolbar-ios-button-color` now has a
default value of `color-contrast($colors-ios, $toolbar-ios-background,
ios)` which will evaluate to the primary color for light background
toolbars and white for dark background toolbars.
- `$bar-button-ios-color` has been renamed to `$toolbar-ios-button-color`
- `$bar-button-ios-border-radius` has been renamed to
`$toolbar-ios-button-border-radius`

- added variables for the toolbar ios title for easier styling:

  ```
  $toolbar-ios-title-font-weight
  $toolbar-ios-title-text-align
  $toolbar-ios-title-text-color
  ```

**Windows Mode**

- `$bar-button-wp-color` was renamed to `$toolbar-wp-button-color`
- `$bar-button-wp-border-radius` was renamed to
`$toolbar-wp-button-border-radius`
- Added `$toolbar-wp-title-text-color` for better control of the title
color
- Removed `$toolbar-wp-button-color` from the default themes

**Material Design Mode**

- `$toolbar-md-button-color` no longer gets passed to the function that
sets the contrast color for toolbar buttons, but it can still be used
to set the default button color.
- `$bar-button-md-color` was renamed to `$toolbar-md-button-color`
- `$bar-button-md-border-radius` was renamed to
`$toolbar-md-button-border-radius`

##### Toggle, Checkbox, Radio ([4c5dd0b](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/commit/4c5dd0b)), ([e075ccd](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/commit/e075ccd)), ([ab82d53](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/commit/ab82d53)) references [#5925](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/5925)

Renamed Sass variables in toggle, checkbox, and
radio. Changed the word `media` in `component-mode-media-padding` (for example)
to `item-left`.
