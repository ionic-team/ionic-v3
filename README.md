[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) is the open-source mobile app development framework that makes it easy to
build top quality native and progressive web apps with web technologies.

Ionic is based on [Angular](https://angular.io/) and comes with many significant performance, usability, and
feature improvements over the past versions.
